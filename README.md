## Off-Grid-PV
Modelling Off Grid PV systems for camera towers. The aim is to model the battery dynamics from historical data so that it is possible to predict how often batteries must be replaced.

#Basic model PVGIS daily
This simple model uses the historic data from the PVGIS to determine how the battery charge state changes through the months of a calander year from set-up.
