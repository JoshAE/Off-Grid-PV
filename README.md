## Off-Grid-PV
Modelling Off Grid PV systems for camera towers. The aim is to model the battery dynamics from historical data so that it is possible to predict how often batteries must be replaced.

#Basic model PVGIS daily
This simple model uses the historic data from the PVGIS to determine how the battery charge state changes through the months of a calander year from set-up.
The parameters that are free for the user to change are:
1. Location: Entered as longitude and lattitude.
2. Surface tilt: Tilt from horzontal of the pannels, this can be enetered as an array with elements corresponding to the number of pannels on the tower
3. Surface azimuth: Azimuth angle from south for each pannel.
4.
